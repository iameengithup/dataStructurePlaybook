Compare and contrast the linear search and binary search algorithms by searching for the numbers 
45 and 54 in the list 3, 8, 12, 34, 54, 84, 91, 110.


LinearSearch
Works on Unsorted List             
Iteration Implementation of int array find the match and exit
Simpler Implementation
Time Complexity O(N)


To search 54  .. 3rd iteration 54 match found loop exits
To search 45 entire int array is iterated match not found returns -1

Binary-Search
Works only on Sorted List
Recursive Implementation
Time Complexity O(log N)


To search 54
int[] is divided into two , less than 54 int[] is dicarded 54, 84, 91, 110
2nd recursion 54,84  --> left hand side answer found base condition satisfied

To search 45
1st recursion  int[] divided into half
3, 8, 12, 34 
54, 84, 91, 110

45 not found base condition met recursion exits with -1
